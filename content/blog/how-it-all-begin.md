So, i just recently build this website and i'm very excited to write my first blog, and the most challenging thing is to find your goddamn topic for your first ever blog. Seriously, it took me a while to come up with a idea. and that is, how it all really started.
<br>
I just passed my 10th grade and it's vacations, not an ordinary one. This is gonna be my last "school" vacation.
<br>
Wait what.. your not gonna continue your studies to 11th grade?...how are you suppose to complete your graduation.
<br>
Hold on..Hold on
<br>
Let me clear it up.
<br>
I applied for a Diploma in Computer Engineering, a 3 year course you can take after your 10th grade.
Honestly, its better coz now i don't have to deal with 11th and 12th chemistry and physics. I know..I know they are fun subjects but when there is just theory and solving random solutions just to get good grades in exams and no practical execution of that knowledge until you become a scientist or something, I'd better stay with my binary understanding electric machine which can solve those random problems before you blink.
<br>
Anyways...school was pretty fun, those days are were precious but now just memories to remember.
<br>
Coming back to the topic, guess what i did in my vacations, i installed parrot os on my machine. For the guys who don't know about parrot os, it's a debian based distro for ethical hacking.
I just installed it because it was cooler than Ubuntu lol!.
<br>
I had some really good time with parrot os, but now i was gaining more knowledge and diving deeper into the rabbit hole.
<br>
Then college happed(First semester of Diploma) but curiosity just took the J curve. Installed Arco and experianced whole new possibilities.
<br>
And finally i took the courage to install Arch and failed multiple times. Now i was a part of so called elite users.
<br>
I'm always learning and looking forward to give back to our community.
<br>
I use Arch BTW!
